Instructions

-Set up a development environment where you:		
    Install the requests module and freeze into the requirements file
	Attempt to have a main.py module to experiment with your implementations
	Ensure to create Github related components, such as a readme, ignore the file, PR template, etc
	You do not need to write unit tests for your implementations in this interview, but create a space for that in the codebase
	
	
-Note that you will be fetching data from a third-party API with documentation at https://reqres.in/
-Create an interface class named ReqresApi and then create an interface method named
	resources : that fetches and returns resources records from the third-party API
